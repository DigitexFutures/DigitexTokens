/*
Base class contracts willing to accept ERC223 token transfers must conform to.

Sender: msg.sender to the token contract, the address originating the token transfer.
          - For user originated transfers sender will be equal to tx.origin
          - For contract originated transfers, tx.origin will be the user that made the tx that produced the transfer.
Origin: the origin address from whose balance the tokens are sent
          - For transfer(), origin = msg.sender
          - For transferFrom() origin = _from to token contract
Value is the amount of tokens sent
Data is arbitrary data sent with the token transfer. Simulates ether tx.data

From, origin and value shouldn't be trusted unless the token contract is trusted.
If sender == tx.origin, it is safe to trust it regardless of the token.
